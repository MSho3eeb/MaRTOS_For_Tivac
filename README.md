**MaRTOS**

MaRTOS is a simple Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) project designed to provide task scheduling and switching functionality. It aims to offer a lightweight and efficient solution for applications requiring multitasking capabilities. This README file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and future plans for enhancements.

**Features**

Task scheduling and switching: MaRTOS enables the creation and execution of multiple tasks in a cooperative multitasking environment.
Simple API: The project provides a straightforward API for task management, allowing users to create, delete, and switch between tasks easily.
Lightweight: MaRTOS is designed to be lightweight, consuming minimal system resources while providing essential RTOS functionality.
Installation
To use MaRTOS in your project, follow these steps:

Clone the MaRTOS repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/MSho3eeb/MaRTOS_For_Tivac.git
Include the necessary source files in your project's build configuration.

Configure your build system to compile the source files and link them with your application.

Ensure that your target platform meets the system requirements of MaRTOS.

Implement the necessary hardware abstraction layer (HAL) functions for your specific hardware setup. These functions will enable MaRTOS to interact with the underlying hardware, such as context switching and timer management.

Customize the task creation and scheduling logic to fit your application's requirements. Refer to the documentation or provided examples for guidance.

Build and flash the project onto your target platform.

Execute the project, and the MaRTOS scheduler will handle task switching based on your configuration.

**Future Plans**

MaRTOS is a work in progress, and there are plans to enhance its functionality in the future. The following features are currently under consideration for implementation:

Mutex: The addition of mutexes will enable synchronization and mutual exclusion between tasks, preventing race conditions when accessing shared resources.

Semaphore: Semaphores allow for signaling and synchronization between tasks, enabling efficient coordination and resource management in complex applications.

Timer management: Implementing timer management functionality will allow tasks to be scheduled based on time intervals, enabling time-based operations and task execution.

Interrupt handling: Enhancements to handle interrupts will improve the responsiveness and real-time capabilities of MaRTOS.

**Contributions**

Contributions to MaRTOS are welcome! If you have any ideas, bug fixes, or enhancements to propose, please submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing code style and include relevant tests and documentation.
